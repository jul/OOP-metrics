Known limitations, why it does not always works?
================================================

Imagine you have a speed and you add speed because you want to know
the speed of a bullet fired at **.5*c** in a space ship travelling at 
**.9*c**. 

What happens? 

Well, you have a problem by finding a speed greater than the speed of light
in a fixed referential. 

The big question is: **is the bug located in the composition of the vectors
or located in the norm?**.

Well, this example not as funny as measuring the distance at which you place
the army in case of a zombie invasion:

- in the nature;
- in squared city (looking like a matrix).
