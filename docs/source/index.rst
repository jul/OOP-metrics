Rationale for a «close to» or «almost equal» operator
=====================================================

A friend once told me
**a solution without a problem is just plain bullshit**

So, let's explain why we need an exact matching operator in programming
language instead of a precise one, and **especially**, what problems it would
solve for real humans. 

Then, let's explain in further details how we have the hints for a solution yet, and 
why we have already difficulties solving it. 

We will then try to reprogram your brain with some back to basics idea, and we
will finally propose an incomplete coded solution.
