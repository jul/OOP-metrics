Distance matters!

Why do we traditionnaly take L2 as a distance? 

Because of Pithagore: a²=c²+b².

And generalized to an n dimension square rectangle the hypothenuse will always
be a²=b²+c²+d²+...+di².

Given an orthonormal set of basis, a² is the square of the distance from the origin.

This distance is peculiarly usefull in case you have to recompute the new coordinate 
when the set of basis are being rotated. It is also fun to notice that given a circle
it enables a simple relation between all hyper volumes of a sphere
1D 2 pi R
2D integral(1D) = pi R² / 2
3D integral(2D) = 4/3 . pi r^3  ...
Nd volume = alpha . pi . r^n
